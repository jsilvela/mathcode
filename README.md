# mathcode

some rough and na√Øve code to support a math post.
Definitely not a good start for a math software system, given that it uses
floating point numbers instead of symbolic manipulation, but it serves
illustrate some points on mathematical exposition (or mis-exposition).

To run it, execute `go main.go`.
