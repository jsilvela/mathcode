# mathcode

some rough and na√Øve code to support a
[math post](https://blog.silvela.org/post/2024-01-14-math-notation/).
Definitely not a good start for a math software system, given that it uses
floating point numbers instead of symbolic manipulation, but it serves
illustrate some points on mathematical exposition (or mis-exposition).

To run it, execute `go main.go` in your terminal.

To get started with Go, go to the [home page](https://go.dev).
